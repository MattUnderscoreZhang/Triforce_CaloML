Use the filter_and_recombine.py script to apply a filter on all files in a folder.

Passing events from the files will be repacked in a new folder in files with the specified number of events per file.

The default filter is for Gamma/Pi0, where we select only events with HCAL/ECAL of less than 0.2.
